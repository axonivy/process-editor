# Axon Ivy Process Editor Client

[![translation-status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/axonivy/process-editor/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/axonivy/)

This repository contains the Axon Ivy (GLSP-based) process editor.

## Prerequisites

The following libraries/frameworks need to be installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 20.19`

The editor is developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
However, it's of course also possible to use another text editor.

---

## Structure

- `packages/editor`: GLSP-based Axon Ivy process editor
- `packages/inscription`: UI extension for element inscription view
- `packages/protocol`: GLSP actions for process editor
- `integration/eclipse`: Eclipse IDE integrations of the process editor
- `integration/standalone`: Standalone integration of the process editor
- `integration/viewer`: Standalone integration of the process viewer (read-only with less tooling)

---

## Building the process editor

The process editor component has to be built using npm.

```bash
#install node modules
npm install

#build typescript
npm run build

#build integrations (sometimes you need to delete the node_modules folder first because of a missing monaco-editor dependency)
npm run package
```

## Running the process editor

The simplest way to start the process editor is by download a
[Axon Ivy Designer](https://developer.axonivy.com/download/nightly) and open a process.
This will launch the latest prebuild **process editor within the eclipse integration**.

- **Standalone**: To start the Standalone integration you can start the Launch
  Standalone config directly inside the VS Code. If it can not open the browser you can
  manually open the browser and modify the URL accordingly:
  http://localhost:3000/?server=localhost:8081&app=designer&pmv=base&file=/processes/testRequestStart.p.json

## Changing the protocol

1. Change the schema in the core
2. Run build core_json-schema
3. Copy the URI of the schema protocol and run `npm run protocol:inscription generate <URI>` in the root
